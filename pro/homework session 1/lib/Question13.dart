/* Question 13
What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void
main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ``` */

void
main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); }


/* In this case, the value of x will be set to 5,
and then a multiplication operation will be performed because it takes precedence over addition,
resulting in 6. After that, it will perform the addition: 5+6, which will yield a result of 11. */
